To Do:

Login works now and flashcards work

1. have an add deck option that interacts with the backend to create a new deck for the user, make sure you can
interact with it in the frontend and make it pretty / fit in

2. when you click on a deck have it go to a flashcards UI where you can navigate through the flashcards front and
back text, with a reveal button that shows the back. Also have an add flashcard option to create a new flashcard.

3. update back end to make things more secure / better and improve standards, maybe watch that youtube tutorial?
Perhaps look into whatever JWT is - check what that youtuber did

4. Try and get it deployed when all finished up
